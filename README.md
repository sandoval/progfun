# Functional Programming Principles in Scala

This are my personal solutions to problems provided by the Functional Programming Principles in Scala course
that can be found on [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/). This repository's purpose is to
store my own solutions. Project structures are provided by the course instructors and therefore these credits
I attribute to them.

It is not the intention of this repository to share solutions with other people currently enrolled at this course
as that would be a violation of Coursera's
[Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code). If you're currently
enrolled at that course please do not access any files from this repository.
